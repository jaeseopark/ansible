## Usage

After Ansible installs the slicer, take the following manual steps:

1. Open the app for the first time and select Bambu A1 & A1 Mini.
1. Install Bambu cloud plugin, login, etc.
1. Run the `orcaslicer-appwide-config.yml` playbook.
1. (Optionally) run the `orcaslicer-user-config.yml` playbook.
    1. Bambu Cloud backs user profile up automaticaly, so this is unnecessary in most cases.
